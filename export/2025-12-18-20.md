- **Abstrat**: Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

- **Abstrat**: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.
